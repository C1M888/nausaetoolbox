    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>This project originated from a request by the NAU SAE Formula and Baja teams to design and build a custom toolbox cart that could meet the demands of their off-road competition environments and on-campus workshop activities. The cart was intended to solve several logistical problems the teams encountered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficulties transporting tools over gravel, grass, and uneven terrain during competitions.</li>
      <li>A lack of organized, lockable storage for tools, spare parts, and safety equipment.</li>
      <li>No built-in method to carry a fire extinguisher, which is required in pit areas.</li>
      <li>Limited access to power sources for charging devices or operating tools in remote settings.</li>
      <li>The need for a compact and ergonomic design that a single team member could operate efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To address these issues, our team applied core engineering principles to create a mobile, functional, and robust toolbox solution. The final product includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A welded steel frame designed for durability and off-road use.</li>
      <li>10-inch rugged casters for enhanced mobility across rough surfaces.</li>
      <li>Multiple lockable drawers and compartments to organize tools.</li>
      <li>A built-in mounting bracket for a fire extinguisher.</li>
      <li>An optional space for a portable power generator.</li>
      <li>Additional features such as a workbench surface, tire rack, and umbrella holder for shaded repairs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project provided an opportunity to integrate CAD design, FEA analysis, and real-world fabrication into a solution tailored to the specific needs of NAUâ€™s SAE teams.</p>
